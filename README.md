# finale

The hardest part was getting all of the code to work together because of how many sources i was using to make the game work. But in my opinion that was the funnest part about making this, seeing all the band aided together code somehow function in the small capacity that it did. I had to rewrite my code several times from scratch when trying to figure out how my attack would function and I kind of got it to work, even though I dont really have hit detection. Overall it was fun to spend my time developing something like this, its really been a while but it was some fun in the very little time I had to spend.
