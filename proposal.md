# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SnakeMan

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where you are a snake and you kill other snakes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Contra style platformer where you as a snake go around killing other snakes for TBD reasons. I bought a how to GODOT package a while back off humblebundle so i might be incorporating that in some way to make things easier for me. Thinking of some type of minimalist progression system; +attack speed, damage, etc. and maybe a storyline not copying nintendo in any way shape or form and multiple enemy types to keep things somewhat interesting. I havent coded a game in python before so I dont really know what to expect, especially with GODOT which is an engine im very unfamiliar with. I have heard good things however and am hopeful.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Me, Myself, and I.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Familiarize myself with the game engine and develop playable levels.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Player character functions as well as the enemies and any other entities I decide to implement.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

By god... it works

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As outlined previously I will need to learn GODOT since im probably going to be relying on the engine. Im not too unfamilliar with sprites but havent done anything related in a while so a refresher will most likely be in order. If I need to write something in another language that I havent really used before Ill probably have to scratch the surface of that. Ive done basic animations in the past but that was also a while ago when I was hellbent on coding games so Ill also have to look into that but Im sure GODOT has support so shouldnt be too terrible.
